    This step will convert the text-related values in the cl100k_base file and output two additional files.

    For the first output file, we'll be decoding the bash64 values which will result in byte literals.  
    For example, the letter A becomes the string literal b'A'.

    For the second output file, we'll decode the base64 values into UTF-8 strings so that we can see double-byte characters.
        For example, character 22656 is the byte literal b'\xe6\x9c\xac' which corresponds to the Japanese kanji æœ¬.
        Sometimes the bytes are not valid UTF-8 so it substitutes the default 'replace' unicode character.
        Sometimes there will be formatting characters like carriage returns that will display weirdness in a text editor.
        cl100k_base_byteliterals.txt and cl100k_base_utf8.txt have been written successfully.
